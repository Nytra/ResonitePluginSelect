# PluginSelect

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that adds some extra UI to the "Start Custom Session" dialog to allow you to select which data model plugins to use for that session.

Works with data model plugins marked as Optional and also those marked as Core such as Project Obsidian. (Note: Those marked as Core MUST be located in the Libraries folder or they won't work with the mod)
